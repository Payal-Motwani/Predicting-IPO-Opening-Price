# Predicting-IPO-Opening-Price
Can we actually predict if an IPO will be successful? Which features increase this probability? This is what this project is about. It scrapes information about recent IPOs, combines it with stock data, cleans and munges the data and finally uses engineered features in a machine learning model to predict the offering success on its first day of trading.

Disclosure: This idea of this project started from my bad experience of investing into Lyft on its first day of trading in 2019. Lyft severely lost it's value after IPO and its price continues to fall. As a newbee in investing, I decided to explore the IPO market to better understand its dynamics in order to avoid similar mistakes in the future.

Disclaimer: This is a learning project to apply Data Science skills in Python. Thus, the insights from this project should not be taken as investment advice.

Dataset:
Data was scraped from Nasdaq API and yahoo finance. All data collection was done in python. Python file nasdaq, nasdaq and yahoo in repo. Data cleaning was also done in python.

Models:
I built a logistic regression and gradient boosting model to predict the prices. This was done in R.

Dashboard and Visualization was done in Tableau
